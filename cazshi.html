      Cazziero is a charming Italian city where you can experience people celebrating authentic <i>campinilismo</i> (roughly meaning local pride). If you come in the winter you get the experience the famous mozzarella festivals which happen around the famous. As if the town wasn't unique enough it has an Indian community which has been around since the late 1700s, they're the reason for the unique decorations pictured below. Some of the best places to stay in Cazziero are Nelglioni Hotel with the famous Mozzarella Lake just nearby. Or you could stay at the very cheap & state-funded DiCioconi, rated four stars.<br><br>
