      MTRPRS is a large, almost maze-like city teeming with cultures &buildings, it can be intimidating but if you find a roof & follow the setting sun you should reach an exit soon enough. A ranking of every, or even most of the hotels is at the moment impossible, MTravel has taken it upon ourselves to build our own near the breach which is paid for by the trip, however there is also a MTRPRSian hotel near enough to the breach that we feel comfortable recommending it, look for the sign with several different variants of the letter S, if you are not familiar with Desi &/or Slavic languages the owners & employees may find it difficult to communicate with you but they will run you about $120 per night if you bargain right. <h2>Please note that trips to MTRPRS are of a limited availability & that MTravel is not responsible for any injury or disappearence that may occur to you & your loved ones.</h2>
